This simple script is connected to pick up object.
It detects the trigger collision with player character and
instantiates a pickup effect and destroys the gameobject.

Pick Up Effect: This slot is for pick up effect. 
(Remember to attach DestroyOverTime script to the effect so they wont fill the hierarchy.)
