Thank you for purchasing POLYTEX - Paradise pack.

Move the player character with WASD or ARROW keys. Jump with SPACE. Turn the Camera with MOUSE.
Make sure you have the Shader Graph enabled.

There are 80 prefabs.
Models are imported in fbx format.
Textures are from 512*512 - 2048*2048 png.

I have added PTX in the end of fbx file names to make it easier to locate models.

This Pack has Settings imported so check them out at Settings folder.
